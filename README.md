# Example Badge 
This is an example badge (applied open badges standard).
You can download the example badge hier: https://nbtkmy.github.io/openbadgesTest/testBadge.svg
and then check it with a validator, if the badge works.
If you need the assertion url, then this: https://nbtkmy.github.io/openbadgesTest/assertion1.json
I've used [the validator of the Open Badge Factory](https://openbadgefactory.com/validator/).

## Note for creating assertion
According to the OpenBadgev2, the issuer object needs the properties as follows:
- id
- type
- name
- url
- email

# Usage of UN SDGs Material

I've taken one icon from the [communications material of the UN](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/news/communications-material/).
Please follow the [guidelines of the UN](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SDG_Guidelines_AUG_2019_Final.pd), if you reuse the icon in this repo.
