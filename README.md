# Example Badge 
This is an example badge (applied open badges standard).
I've used [the validator of the Open Badge Factory](https://openbadgefactory.com/validator/).

According to the OpenBadgev2, the issuer object needs the properties as follows:
- id
- type
- name
- url
- email

See the [Open Badges v2.0, final release](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html#Profile)
