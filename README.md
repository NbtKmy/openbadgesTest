# Example Badge 
This is an example badge (applied open badges standard).
You can download the example badge here: https://nbtkmy.github.io/openbadgesTest/testBadge.svg
and then check it with a validator, if the badge works.

If you need the assertion url, then this: https://nbtkmy.github.io/openbadgesTest/assertion1.json

For the validation, I've used [the validator of the Open Badge Factory](https://openbadgefactory.com/validator/) and [IMS Global Open Badges 2.0 Validator](https://openbadgesvalidator.imsglobal.org/).
If you use the IMS Global Open Badges 2.0 Validator, you should use the assertion url above.


## Note for creating assertion
According to the OpenBadgev2, the issuer object needs the properties as follows:
- id
- type
- name
- url
- email

If you hashed the identity, you need to add your hash algorithm like "sha256$" before the hash string.

# Usage of UN SDGs Material

I've taken one icon from the [communications material of the UN](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/news/communications-material/).
Please follow the [guidelines of the UN](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SDG_Guidelines_AUG_2019_Final.pd), if you reuse the icon in this repo.
